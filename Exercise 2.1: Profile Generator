Create a PHP file called profile.php. In this file:
1.	Define the following variables:
    $fullName (string)
    $birthYear (int)
    $currentYear (use date("Y") to get it dynamically)
    $isStudent (boolean)
    $schoolName (string)

2.	Calculate the age of the person.
3.	Display a full profile message. If $isStudent is true, say:
    Hello, my name is [fullName], I am [age] years old, and I study at [schoolName].

If $isStudent is false, say:
    Hello, my name is [fullName], I am [age] years old, and I am not currently studying.
